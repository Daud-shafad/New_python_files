# Challenge 2: Find the Largest Number

# Have a list of numbers.

# Use a while loop and an index variable.

# Compare each number with a variable holding the largest found so far.

# At the end, print the largest number.

num_list = [7, 4, 2, 9, 10, 5]

i = 10

while num_list > i:
    if num_list[0] == i:
        print("the largest number was found and it's: ", num_list[0])
    elif num_list[1] == i:
        print[i]
