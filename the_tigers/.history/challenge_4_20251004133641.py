#  Challenge 4: Search for a Value

# Have a list of numbers.

# Use a while loop with index to search for a specific number stored in a variable.

# If found, print "Found" and stop the loop.

# If the loop finishes without finding it, print "Not Found".

    if i == num_list[2]:
        print("Found")
        break
    else:
