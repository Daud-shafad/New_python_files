## Challenge: Employee Management System

# Create an employee management system using dictionaries and lists.
# The dictionary should store: employee_id as key, and [name, department, salary] as value.
# Menu Options:
# 1. Add Employee (ask for id, name, department, salary)
# 2. Update Salary (ask for employee id and new salary)
# 3. View Employee Details (ask for employee id)
# 4. View All Employees in Department (ask for department name)
# 5. Exit
# Use while loop for menu, if/else for conditions, and match for menu options.
# Example structure:
# employees = {
# 101: ["John", "IT", 50000],
# 102: ["Sarah", "HR", 45000] }
