# Challenge 3: The Shape Calculator

# Use a while loop to create a persistent menu.

# The menu asks the user to choose a shape: 

# "1. Circle", "2. Rectangle", "3. Triangle", "4. Quit".

# Use if/else to check for the quit command.

# Use a match statement for the shapes.

# For 'Circle', ask for the radius and calculate the area.

# For 'Rectangle', ask for length and width and calculate the area.

# For 'Triangle', ask for base and height and calculate the area.

# After each calculation, print the result and return to the main menu.
