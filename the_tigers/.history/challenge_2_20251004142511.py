# Challenge 2: Find the Largest Number

# Have a list of numbers.

# Use a while loop and an index variable.

# Compare each number with a variable holding the largest found so far.

# At the end, print the largest number.

num_list = [7, 4, 2, 9, 10, 5]
champ = 7

while  champ <= 10:
        champ == num_list[0] + 1
        champ += 1
        print(champ)
