# Challenge 2: Student Attendance Tracker

# Create a dictionary with student names and set their attendance as False by default.

# Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the teacher for present students' names.

# If a name exists in the dictionary, change attendance to True.

# Stop the loop if the teacher types "done".

# At the end, print out the final dictionary showing each studentâ€™s attendance (True or False).
