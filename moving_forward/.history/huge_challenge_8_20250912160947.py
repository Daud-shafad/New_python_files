# Challenge 4: Temperature Range Checker

# Ask the user to input today’s temperature.

# Store it in a list.

# Use match with guards to classify:

# Below 0 → "Freezing"

# 0–15 → "Cold"

# 16–25 → "Mild"

# 26–35 → "Warm"

# Above 35 → "Hot"

# Use a boolean + operator to check if it’s a “comfortable” range (16–25).

# Print both classification and boolean.
