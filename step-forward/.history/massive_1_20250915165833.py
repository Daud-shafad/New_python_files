# Challenge 1: Personal Expense Tracker

# Ask the user repeatedly (while loop) to enter expenses: name of the item and cost.

# Store items and costs in a dictionary.

# Add each cost to a list of expenses and set of unique item names.

# Convert costs to float (casting), calculate total and average (operators, numbers).

# Use if/else to categorize: expense > 100 â†’ "high", else "low".

# At the end, print: total cost, average, all items (tuple) and unique item names (set).
