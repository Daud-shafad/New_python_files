# Challenge 3: Inventory Checker

# Maintain a dictionary of items and their quantities.

# Keep asking the user (while loop) to input an item name and amount to add/remove.

# Store all transactions in a list.

# Track unique items in a set.

# Use casting for amounts to integers.

# Use if/else to check: item exists → update quantity, else → add new item.

# Use operators to update quantity.

# At the end, print full inventory (dictionary) and all unique items (set/tuple).
