# Challenge 2: Student Grade Analyzer

# Keep asking user (while loop) for student names and scores (0–100).

# Store scores in a dictionary with names as keys.

# Keep all scores in a list for analysis.

# Convert input to integer (casting).

# Use if/else or match with guards to categorize grades:

# 90–100 → "A"

# 80–89 → "B"

# 70–79 → "C"

# 60–69 → "D"

# <60 → "F"

# Calculate average score (operators, numbers) and print a summary tuple of counts per grade.
