# ğŸ”¸ Challenge C: Grade Summary

# Keep asking user for grades (numbers 0â€“100) using while until they enter -1 to stop.

# Use if/else or match to categorize each grade into "pass" (>=60) or "fail" (<60).

# Use a dictionary to count how many passed and how many failed.

# At the end (after -1), print the dictionary: e.g. {"pass": 5, "fail": 2}.
