# Challenge 5: Simple Banking Simulator

# Keep a variable for user balance (number).

# Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for action: deposit, withdraw, or check balance.

# Store all transactions in a list.

# Keep unique transaction types in a set.

# Use casting for amounts.

# Use if/else to check: withdraw > balance â†’ deny, else allow.

# Use operators for updating balance.

# Print a dictionary summary of transactions (total deposits, total withdrawals).

# At the end, print a tuple: final balance, total transactions, unique actions.
