# ðŸ”¹ Challenge Idea: Daily Workout Logger

# ðŸ‘‰ Description:
# Create a program that helps a user track their daily workouts.

# The program should keep asking the user to enter a workout name 
# (like "pushups", "squats", "running") and the number of minutes spent.

# Store the data in a dictionary where the key is the workout name 
# and the value is the total minutes spent on that workout.

# If the user enters the same workout again, 
# add the minutes to the existing total (so it keeps accumulating).

# Stop asking when the user types "stop".

# At the end:

# Print the full workout dictionary.

# Print the total minutes spent on all workouts.

# Print the workout with the maximum minutes (the one they did the most).
