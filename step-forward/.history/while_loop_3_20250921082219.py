# Challenge 3: Count Up

# Start from 1.

# Use a while loop to print numbers until 10.

# Stop when 10 is printed.

count = 1

while count <= 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    



# Challenge 7: Count until 5
# count = 0
# while count < 5:
  #  print("Current count is:", count)
   # count = count + 1
