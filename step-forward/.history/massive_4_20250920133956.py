# Challenge 4: Number Guess Statistics

# Generate a secret number (fixed variable) or ask user to input it.

# Let another user guess numbers (while loop).

# Store all guesses in a list.

# Track unique guesses in a set.

# Use casting for number inputs.

# Use operators and booleans to check: guess <, >, or = secret.

# Use if/else or match statement to print hints: "Too high", "Too low", "Correct".

# After correct guess, print statistics tuple: number of attempts, min guess, max guess, average guess.
