# ðŸ“Œ Challenge:
# Create a "Mini CafÃ© Ordering System" that does the following:

# Store the cafÃ© name in a variable.

# Store at least three menu items and their prices using two lists (one for items, one for prices).

# Ask the user for their name.

# Show the menu using a tuple.

# Ask the user to choose a menu item by typing its name.

# Ask how many they want (cast input to integer).

# Use if/else to check if the item exists in the menu.

# If it exists, calculate and show the total cost.

# If it doesnâ€™t exist, show an error message.

# Ask if they want to eat in or take away using a match statement.

# Show a final confirmation message.

# End program when the order is done.
