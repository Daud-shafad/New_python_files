# Day 5: Loops + conditions â†’ guess the number game

# The computer secretly picks a random target number.
# Use a loop to repeatedly ask the player for guesses.
# Check each guess with conditions - too high, too low, or correct.
# If correct, celebrate and exit the loop.
# If wrong, give hints and continue until the player succeeds.
