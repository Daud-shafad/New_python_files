# Day 4: Sets + lists + conditions â†’ unique word counter.

# Start with a list of words containing duplicates.
# Create an empty set to store unique words found.
# Check each word in the list using conditions.
# If the word is not in the set, add it to track uniqueness.
# The final set size gives the count of unique words.
