# Challenge 35: Ultimate Data Collector 
# (variables + lists + tuples + dictionaries + sets + if/else) 
# (casting + booleans + operators + inputs + outputs)

# Ask the user to enter 3 numbers using input.

# Cast the inputs from string to integers and store them in a list.

# Convert the list into a set to remove duplicates.

# Store the original 3 numbers as a tuple.

# Create a dictionary where the keys are the numbers and the values are "Even" or "Odd" based on the number.

# Use if/else and operators to check if the sum of the numbers is greater than 50.

# Store the result in a boolean variable is_large_sum.

# Print all of the following:

# The list of numbers entered

# The tuple of numbers

# The set of unique numbers

# The dictionary of numbers with "Even"/"Odd"

# The boolean result is_large_sum
