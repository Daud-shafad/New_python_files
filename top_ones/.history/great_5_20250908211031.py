# Challenge Idea:

# Build a student management mini-system that:

# Asks the user to input a student’s name and age (use variables).

# Stores the names inside a list, and ages inside a tuple.

# Creates a dictionary where each student’s name is the key and their age is the value.

# Keeps a set of all unique ages entered.

# Uses casting (e.g., convert input string → integer for age).

# Uses if/else to check conditions (e.g., if age ≥ 18 → “adult”, else → “minor”).

# Uses booleans + operators to test (e.g., if student age is >= 18 and <= 25).

# Shows the final stored data (output everything clearly).
