# 🏆 Main Challenge

 # Create a dictionary called students that stores 3 student names as keys and their marks as numbers.
# 🔹 Use a while loop to keep checking each student’s marks:

# If marks are >= 50, set the value for that student’s key to True (pass).

# If marks are < 50, set the value to False (fail).
#🔹 Stop the loop after all students are checked.
#🔹 Finally, print the updated dictionary showing student name → pass/fail (True/False).
